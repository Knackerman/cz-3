            <h4>Chess is a two-player board game using a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end in checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways. </h4>

            <h4>Chess is played on a chessboard, a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which is similar to that used in draughts (checkers) (FIDE 2008). No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called "light" or "white", and the darker-colored squares are called "dark" or "black". Sixteen "white" and sixteen "black" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ranks and vertical rows are called files.</h4>

        <div class="tab-pane" id="3" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab">
            <h4>1. Start Slow – The board, the pieces, and the rules Introduce the board and the squares first. Then teach each piece individually and show their full range of movement. Use mini-games like pawns vs. pawns only or just pawns & kings. Only use the full set when the student can demonstrate full knowledge of every piece. Once students can play with all of the pieces, spend a lot of time on the differences between check, checkmate, and stalemate. 2. Encourage Thoughtful Calculation Tell students that chess is the only game where you can tell the future! Tell them to list the options in their heads. Make sure they are calculating the opponent’s moves as well as their own. Then choose the best move after they take their time. And, for the perfectionists, to choose good practical moves instead of trying to calculate everything. 3. Make Sportsmanship a Priority Have students start the game with a handshake and “good luck”. They should end each game with a handshake and say “good game”, no matter who won. Stress that it is important to play by the rules and learn from their mistakes. Disputes are bound to happen but be clear that arguing is not acceptable. They should raise their hands and ask for help from the teacher/tournament director when they cannot agree. These basic rules will help keep the classroom civil and foster polite, respectful development.</h4>
